# Filecloud

Requirements
------------
The requirements for running Boxroom are:

 * Preferably Ruby 1.9.3, but 1.9.2 and 1.8.7 should work too
 * Rails 3.2.11
 * A database (e.g. MySQL or SQLite)

Mail settings
-------------
Filecloud sends email when users want to reset their password or when they share files.
For this to work, depending on your environment, you have op to open
`config/environments/development.rb` or `config/environments/production.rb`, uncomment
the following lines and fill in the correct settings of your mail server:

    # config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :smtp
    # config.action_mailer.smtp_settings = {
    #   :address => 'mailhost',
    #   :port => 587,
    #   :user_name => 'user_name',
    #   :password => 'password',
    #   :authentication => 'plain'
    # }

In order for Filecloud to send a user to the correct URL for either downloading a shared
file or for resetting passwords, you have to uncomment and update the following:

    # config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { :host => 'localhost:3000' }

You also have to choose a from address for the emails that will be sent. You can do
this by uncommenting and adjusting the following line:

    # ActionMailer::Base.default :from => 'Filecloud <yourname@yourdomain.com>'
